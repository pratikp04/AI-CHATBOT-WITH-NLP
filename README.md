Objective: The goal of Task 3 was to build a simple AI chatbot that could understand and respond to user inputs using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot should be able to recognize greetings, provide answers to basic queries, and simulate a conversational flow.

Tools and Libraries Used:

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): For processing and understanding basic natural language input.

nltk.chat.util.Chat: To handle pattern matching and user interaction.

Approach: To keep the chatbot simple and efficient, I used the nltk.chat.util module, which allows defining pattern-response pairs. These are predefined rules where a certain input (pattern) from the user triggers a corresponding output (response).

For example, if a user says "hi", the chatbot replies with "Hello!" or "Hi there!". Similarly, if the user asks "What is your name?", the chatbot can respond with "I'm your AI Chatbot."

The script loops through a list of such patterns and responses and continues to interact with the user until they type “bye” or “exit”.

Output and Features:

Responds to greetings and common questions

Recognizes help queries and casual conversations

Can handle exit commands like “bye”, “exit”, or “quit”

If it doesn’t understand a question, it replies politely asking for clarification

Example conversation:

vbnet Copy Edit You: hi Bot: Hello!

You: what is your name? Bot: I'm your AI Chatbot.

You: bye Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day! Learning Outcomes:

Learned how simple NLP rules can create engaging chatbot experiences

Understood pattern matching using regular expressions in NLP

Explored how to use reflections for dynamic conversation

Learned the structure of chatbots and how they can be expanded into more intelligent systems using ML and DL

Conclusion: This chatbot was a rule-based, console-level AI assistant. Although basic, it forms the foundation of more advanced systems that integrate deep learning models or voice interaction. The task helped me understand the building blocks of NLP-driven bots and the potential to expand them for real-world applications such as customer service, FAQs, or personal assistants.
